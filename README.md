# 3D-FasterRCNN
3D object detection system in monocular images of a synthetic environment (GTAV). <br>
This is my own implementation of 3D Faster-RCNN using Pytorch. <br>
3D ROIs are created to train a "Region Proposal Network" (RPN) inside the architecture, in order to guess good and promising 3D boxes.<br>

The following video shows vehicles and pedestrians detection.
